# Investigating Netflix Movies - DataCamp
Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover insights about movies from a particular decade.

In this Project, we answer the following questions:

-  What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).
-  A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.
